## Route Groups:
 Rout grouping is an special NextJS feature which refers to grouping of closely related routes 

# Example:
We have 3 forms in our application which are located as "/Login" (for login) "/Signup" (for signup) and "/subscribe" (for subscription)

thus we create a folder named like this (forms) and move these three forms in that folder . This will enhance code readability without changing application structure 

for more consise example , see the application tree . There is a route group called (auth) which is managing forms all over the application
