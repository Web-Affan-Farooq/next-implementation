1. where are the all elements rendered in react when I called root.render();
ans: div with id "root"

2. what would show up in console If I were to run this line of code console.log(<h1>This is div</h1>)
ans: instance of object containing properties of that element i.e element name etc

3. what's wrong with this code 
root.render(
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <h3>Hi</h3>
)
